Yes — there are several ways to **amplify distinctions** between architecture options in your scorecard. Here’s how you can do it:

------

## ✅ 1. **Adjust the Weight Distribution**

- **Increase the weight** on criteria where differences are significant
- Example: If *Feature Completeness* or *Time to Deploy* is where platforms diverge most, increase those weights from `0.10` → `0.25`
- This makes standout strengths/weaknesses more impactful

🔧 Edit your `weights.csv` like:

| Criteria                | Weight |
| ----------------------- | ------ |
| Feature Completeness    | 0.25   |
| Time to Deploy          | 0.20   |
| Total Cost of Ownership | 0.10   |
| ...                     | ...    |

------

## ✅ 2. **Use Exponential or Non-linear Scaling (Advanced)**

Instead of linearly combining scores, **amplify the gaps**:

- Use **squared scores**: `score^2 × weight`
- Or use **z-score normalization** (mean-centered) to stretch out variance

This makes small raw score gaps (e.g., 8 vs. 7) more impactful:

```python
adjusted = (score ** 2) * weight
```

I can add a toggle in Streamlit for:

- 📈 Linear (default)
- 🚀 Amplified (squared)
- 🧪 Z-Score Normalized

------

## ✅ 3. **Collapse Redundant Platforms**

If several platforms (e.g., OpenMetadata, DataHub, Amundsen) score closely across all categories:

- Consider **grouping similar tools**
- Or highlight **relative rankings per criterion** (e.g., top 3 per criterion)

------

## ✅ 4. **Add a Visual Spread (chart tricks)**

- Use bar chart **color intensity** or **error bars**
- Add **delta labels** (e.g., “+12% vs. next best”)

------

Would you like me to:

- 🔧 Add the **amplified scoring** toggle to your Streamlit app?
- 📉 Re-rank the platforms using squared scores and show new chart?

Just say the word.
