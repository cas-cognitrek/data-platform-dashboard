| AWS Native + Custom |     4 | Requires designing and developing a fully custom governance layer. Involves significant effort to build catalog, lineage, glossary, and workflow features from scratch. | [AWS Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/index.html), [Lake Formation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/) |
| AWS + Atlan         |     9 | Atlan is SaaS-based and integrates natively with AWS. Fast setup with guided onboarding and managed infra. Typically deploys in days or weeks. | [Atlan integration docs](https://docs.atlan.com/docs/aws-integration-guide) |
| AWS + Collibra      |     6 | Collibra deployment can be complexâ€”requires coordination with sales, architects, and sometimes professional services. Cloud-based but slower ramp-up. | [Collibra product overview](https://www.collibra.com/us/en/products/data-catalog) |
| AWS + Informatica   |     5 | Enterprise-oriented with high configurability. Setup often requires Informatica consultants. Cloud-native version exists but onboarding time is moderate to high. | [Informatica Cloud Data Governance](https://www.informatica.com/products/data-quality/data-governance.html) |
| AWS + OpenMetadata  |     6 | Self-hosted OSS, but Docker/Kubernetes-ready. Quick to deploy technically, but still requires configuration for AWS-specific metadata sources and workflows. | [OpenMetadata Deployment](https://docs.open-metadata.org/deployment/) |
| AWS + DataHub       |     6 | Docker-based deployment is straightforward. AWS ingestion connectors exist, but setup requires tuning. Not as fast as Atlan, but faster than enterprise tools. | [DataHub Quickstart](https://datahubproject.io/docs/deployment/quickstart/) |
| AWS + Amundsen      |     5 | Minimalist OSS tool. Fast to install via Docker, but lacks guided AWS integrations or robust setup documentation. AWS lineage/glossary must be built manually. | [Amundsen Installation](https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/installation/) |
