| AWS Native + Custom |     6 | No licensing cost, but high development and maintenance overhead (custom UI, workflows, metadata sync, lineage graph); infrastructure (e.g., Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Glue) also adds AWS cost. | [AWS pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/), [Glue pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/) |
| AWS + Atlan         |     7 | SaaS model with license costs, but reduces infra and engineering overhead. Pricing is negotiable but mid-tier vs. enterprise tools. Native AWS integration simplifies setup. | [Atlan pricing](https://atlan.com/pricing/), [Atlan docs](https://docs.atlan.com/) |
| AWS + Collibra      |     5 | Enterprise pricing (6-figure/year), plus possible infrastructure or professional services. Best suited for large organizations. TCO is higher due to complex deployment. | [Collibra analyst reports](https://www.collibra.com/us/en/resource/gartner-mq-data-governance) |
| AWS + Informatica   |     4 | Typically the highest in TCO: enterprise pricing (often bundles with other tools), high integration/setup effort, and support plans. | [Informatica pricing guide (G2)](https://www.g2.com/products/informatica-pricing), [IDC Total Economic Impact](https://www.informatica.com/about-us/analyst-reports/forrester-tei-of-informatica.html) |
| AWS + OpenMetadata  |     8 | Open-source, self-hosted. No license cost, but infra cost depends on deployment (e.g., ECS, EKS, RDS). Lightweight dev/ops effort vs. custom. | [OpenMetadata pricing](https://open-metadata.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata) |
| AWS + DataHub       |     8 | Also open-source. Slightly higher ops complexity than OpenMetadata, but still low TCO due to no license cost. Self-hosted or managed option (Acryl DataHub). | [DataHub by Acryl](https://www.acryl.io/), [GitHub](https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub) |
| AWS + Amundsen      |     9 | Fully open-source, low infra cost, minimal features (no complex workflows), so lowest TCO. Very lightweight option. | [Amundsen GitHub](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen), [Blog](https://www.amundsen.io/blog/) |
